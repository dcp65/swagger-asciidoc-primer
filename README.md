# swagger-asciidoc-primer

This project describes some approaches to generating API reference documentation using the Swaggwer (OpenAPI) 
specification and AsciiDoc.

To view the generated documentation, clone this repository and run the following from the root of the project directory:

```
./gradlew asciidoctor
```

Generated HTML and PDF is available in the project `build` directory.

Alternatively, you can view the document, as rendered by GitHub, from the [project source](./src/asciidoc/index.adoc).
